This is a quick ultimate tic-tac-toe game written in Python with pygame.

The only necessary module to install is PyGame (```pip install pygame```).

Future improvements if I come back to this side project:
* Embedding the game in a PyQt5 GUI
* Adding an AI computer player option so users can play against one another or a computer
* Setting to adjust some of the rules/behavior (what happens when a square is filled, etc...)
